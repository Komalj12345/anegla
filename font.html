    <h2>Dr. Angela Yu</h2>

    <p>I'm Angela, I'm a developer with a passion for teaching. I'm the lead instructor at the London App Brewery,
        London's leading Programming Bootcamp. I've helped hundreds of thousands of students learn to code and change
        their lives by becoming a developer. I've been invited by companies such as Twitter, Facebook and Google to
        teach their employees.</p>

    <p>My first foray into programming was when I was just 12 years old, wanting to build my own Space Invader game.
        Since then, I've made hundred of websites, apps and games. But most importantly, I realised that my greatest
        passion is teaching.

        I spend most of my time researching how to make learning to code fun and make hard concepts easy to understand.
        I apply everything I discover into my bootcamp courses. In my courses, you'll find lots of geeky humour but also
        lots of explanations and animations to make sure everything is easy to understand.</p>
